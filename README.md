# Wordle Solver

A greedy min-max solver for the now famous
[Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/); it attempts to minimize the
number of possible answers after each guess. This may not be globally optimal,
but it's probably pretty close and at least shows that a solution does exist.

## TODO

* Check edge cases for hard mode constraints against actual game behaviour.
